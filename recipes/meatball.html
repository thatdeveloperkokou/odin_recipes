        <img src="images/meatball (2).jpg" alt="pizza image">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These tasty Italian meatballs (polpette) start off in the oven,<br> and finish by simmering in a simple tomato sauce.<br> We love them as a main dish, with a side of sautéed zucchini and a salad.</p>
        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><i>1 pound ground sweet Italian pork sausage</i></li>
            <li><i>pound ground beef</i></li>
            <li><i>2/3 cup minced shallot</i></li>

            <li><i>1/2 cup whole milk</i></li>
            <li><i>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (see Note)</i></li>
            <li><i>1 cup water</i></li>
            <li><i>2 (24-ounce) jars tomato puree</i></li>
            <li><i>5 cloves garlic, minced</i></li>
            <li><i>1 teaspoon Italian herb seasoning blend</i></li>
            <li><i>salt to taste</i></li>
            <li><i>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, or as needed</i></li>
            <li><i>fresh basil leaves</i></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>STEPS</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>
              <p>
                <li>Combine sausage, ground beef, shallot, Parmesan cheese, and breadcrumbs in a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to break up the ground meat and roughly mix ingredients together. Stir in beaten eggs, milk, and black pepper. Use your hands to mix all ingredients well.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Pour water into a shallow bowl, and moisten fingertips and palms with water. Shape meatball mixture into about 40 ping-pong sized balls and place on the prepared sheet pan. When fingers become sticky, dip them in water.</li>
                <li>Bake meatballs in the preheated oven until lightly browned and a bit underdone in the center, about 20 minutes. If meatballs are larger, adjust baking time.</li>
                <li>Pour tomato purée into a large sauce pot or a Dutch oven set over medium-low heat. Stir in minced garlic and Italian herbs. Sample the sauce for seasoning, and adjust, if needed.</li>
                <li>When sauce begins to bubble slightly, add meatballs and stir gently, coating all the meatballs with sauce. Keep meatballs and sauce at a low simmer and cook, uncovered, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>To serve, place meatballs and sauce on a plate, drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, garnish with fresh basil leaves, and sprinkle with additional grated Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
              </p>
            </h4>
        </ol>
        <h3>COOK'S NOTE:</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>No salt is added in the meatballs because the sweet Italian sausage, seasoned breadcrumbs, and Parmesan cheese add quite a bit of salt. Taste finished dish and season with salt if necessary.</strong>
